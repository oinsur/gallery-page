## Overview

This is the fifth project in the responsive web developer path for devchallenges.io

The demo I did for the solution can be found at https://oinsur.github.io/gallery-page/

I was very pleased with my result. I feel that I have learned some new techniques for working with HTML & CSS.
One challenge that I had was with the images in the grid. I had worked with grid previously, but had not done
a mosaic layout in an image gallery. I had to do some research about how to do that which is mentioned in the
acknowledments section of this file. I was also able to minimize my media queries by using percentages for settings
such as margins and paddings.
